Knight's Tour on Modified 8x8 chessboard with corners removed.

A Streamlit application that visualizes a Knight's Tour on a modified 8x8 chessboard with the four corners removed. The app uses Warnsdorff's algorithm to find a valid tour and provides an interactive visualization of the knight's path. The Python source code was generated using Cascade Write mode in Windsurf.

Features:

Interactive selection of starting position
Animated visualization of the knight's path
Modified 8x8 chessboard with corners removed
Visual indication of removed corners and visited squares
When the application is run, you'll see: A title "Knight's Tour Visualization", Input fields for selecting the starting position (X and Y coordinates from 0-7), and A "Find Tour" button to start the visualization.

To use the application: Choose starting coordinates (avoid the corners: (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), and (7,7) as they are removed). Click "Find Tour". A modified 8x8 chessboard with the corners removed will be displayed. Removed corners are marked with ‚ùå. The knight's path will be animated on the board. The visualization will show you how the knight moves through all the available squares while avoiding the removed corners. The numbers on the board show the order of moves.

This is my very first repository on Github. I just started learning. Please bear with me. Thank you!
